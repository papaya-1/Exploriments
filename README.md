## üåå Overview

**Exploriments** is our official submission for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** ‚Äî  
an AI-powered research navigator designed to make NASA‚Äôs *Space Biology* research more accessible and understandable.  

Our project automatically collects, categorizes, and summarizes scientific papers focused on **environmental factors**, **biological systems**, **living systems**, etc studied in space, into categories such as **microgravity**, **neuroscience**, **immune response**, **metabolism**, and **microrganisms**.  

It has the logic for extracting full-text papers, uses **Hugging Face AI models** for summarization, and categorizes articles. 

This repo contains the backend logic for our program with the front-end developed on Figma to show how it will eventually be trasferred over as a website.
